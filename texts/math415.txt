2. Decide if the following matrices are positive definite, negative definite or indefinite

(1) A =

 2 −1 −1−1 2 −1
−1 −1 2


(2) ∗ B =

 2 −1 −1−1 2 1
−1 1 2


(3) C =

0 1 21 0 1
2 1 0

2

Solution. We use the leading minors test on the first 2.

(1) det[2] = 2, det

[
2 −2
−1 2

]
= 3, but det

 2 −1 −1−1 2 −1
−1 −1 2

 = 0 so A is not definite.
(2) det[2] = 2 > 0, det

[
2 −2
−1 2

]
= 3, and det

 2 −1 −1−1 2 −1
−1 −1 2

 = 6. They are all positive
so B is positive definite.

(3) Note that the columns of the matrix shown are independent, since the matrix is sym-
metric this means its eigenvalues are non-zero real numbers. Since C is the square of
that matrix, its eigenvalues are squares of the previous eigenvalues and therefore are all
positive. C is Positive definite.

3. Consider the matrix A =

[
1 b
b 9

]
for b ∈ R.

(1) For which numbers b is the matrix positive definite?
(2) Factor A = LDLT in terms of b, when b is in the range for positive definiteness.
(3) Find the minimum value of 1

2
(x2 + 2bxy + 9y2)− y for b in this range.

Solution. (1) We check the eigenvalues (there are more effective ways to check positive
definiteness but we will need eigenvalues in part (2) anyways so...). The characteristic
polynomial is p(λ) = (1−λ)(9−λ)−b2 = λ2−10λ+9−b2. Using the quadratic formula
we get rational-conjugate eigenvalues λ1 = 5 +

√
16 + b2 and λ2 = 5−

√
16 + b2. From

here, the one at risk of being negative is λ2. We need the second term to be less than 5,
so the argument of the square root should be less than 25. This is achieved by picking
b ∈ (−3, 3).

(2) We already have the eigenvalues so we compute the eigenvectors.

A− λ1I =
[
−4−

√
16 + b2 b

b 4−
√

16 + b2

]
so the nul space equation gives (−4 −

√
16 + b2)x1 = bx2 = 0 which produces the

eigenvector v1 =

[
b

4 +
√

16 + b2

]
. By way of rational conjugates we know v2 =[

b

4−
√

16 + b2

. After normilizing we obtain

(3) Let q denote the quadratic form in question. To find the critical point we want to make

the gradient zero. qx = x+ by, qy = bc = x+ 9y− 1. So the critical point occurs at the

solution of the system A

[
x
y

]
=

[
0
1

]
, which is y = 1

9−b2 , x =
−b

9−b2 . Since A is positive

definite, we know the critical point is a minimum.

4. Consider the quadratic form q(x, y, z) = 3x2 + 10xy + 3y2 + z2

(1) Find the symmetric matrix A for q.
(2) Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

(3) Give a formula for q in the coordinates of the vector

xy
z

 in the eigenbasis of A.
(4) Is q positive definite, negative definite or indefinite?

Solution. (1) Since the only term containing z is teh z2 term, we can quickly see that

A =

3 5 05 3 0
0 0 1


(2) The characteristic polynomial is p(λ) = (λ2 − 6λ− 16)(1− λ) = (λ− 1)(λ− 8)(λ+ 2),

so the eigenvalues are λ1 = 1, λ2 = −2, λ3 = 8. To find eigenvectors we compute the
eigenspace of each eigenvalue.

A− λ1I =

2 5 05 2 0
0 0 0

 ,

so v1 =

00

A− λ2I =

5 5 05 5 0

so v2 =

.
A− λ3I =

−5 5 05 −5 0
0 0 −7

 ,
so v2 =

11


(3) Normalizing the vectors before we get the orthonormal eigenbasis B =

−1/√21/√2

 ,
1/√21/√2

In order to write q in the coordinates of B, we need to write the vector

xy
z

 in those co-
ordinates. This is done by multiplying by the change of basis matrix IBE = B

−1 = BT .

We compute BTx =

 zy−x√

2

. We then get
q(x, y, z) = z2 − 2(y − x√

2
)2 + 8(

x+ y√
2

)2.

(4) Since q has both negative and positive coefficients, it follows that it is indefinite.

5. ∗ Consider the matrix A =
[
0 −1
1 2

]
.

(1) List the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A. Is A diagonalizable?
(2) Check that B = ATA is diagonalizable (Hint: spectral theorem). Find an orthogonal

matrix U =
[
u1 u2

]
and diagonal matrix D =

[
σ21 0
0 σ22

]
such that B = UDUT .

(3) Check that C = AAT is diagonalizable. Find an orthogonal matrix V =
[
v1 v2

]
and

diagonal matrix D̃ =

[
µ21 0
0 µ22

]
such that B = V D̃V T .

(4) What is the relation between D and D̃?
(5) Is U = V ?
(6) Compute UDV T and compare it to A.

Solution. (1) The characteristic polynomial is −λ(2 − λ) + 1 = (λ − 1)2. Hence we get a

single eigenvalue λ = 1. A−I =
[
−1 −1
1 1

]
so there is only one independent eigenvector.

For instance

[
−1
1

]
. Therefore A is not diagonalizable.

(5) U 6= V

6. Let A =

[
1 4
2 8

]
(1) Compute the eigenvalues σ21, σ

2
2 of AA

T .
(2) Compute the eigenvectors u1,u2. Check that they are orthonormal.

Solution. (1) AAT =

[
17 34
34 68

]
. The characteristic polynomial is λ2−85λ so the eigenvalues

are σ21 = 85 and σ
2
2 = 0.

(2) By computing the null space of A−85I, one can check that u1 =
[ 1√

5
2√

]
. We can also see

that in the original matrix, the second column is twice the first one. So the a normalized

eigenvector corresponding to σ22 = 0 is u2 =

7. True or False? Provide reasoning.

(1) If A is a symmetric matrix then it is diagonalizable and all its eigenvalues are real.
(2) If A is a diagonalizable matrix whose eigenvalues are all real then A is symmetric.
(3) If A has an orthonormal eigenbasis then A is symmetric.
(4) If f is a quadratic form whose associated matrix is positive definite then f has a maxi-

mum at the origin.
(5) If f is a quadratic form whose associated matrix is negative definite then f has a max-

imum at the origin.
(6) A symmetric matrix is always definite
(7) A matrix whose eigenvalues are all non-negative is positive definite

Solution. (1) True. This is the spectral theorem.
(2) False. Take any strictly triangular matrix with real numbers on the diagonal.
(3) True. If A is such a matrix, then it has a diagonalization of the form A = QDQT . Then

AT = (QDQT )T = (QT )TDTQT = QDQT = A.
(4) False, Positive definite quadratic form has a minimum.

(1) Check that the columns of C form an orthonormal basis of Rn. Call this basis C.
(2) Let v in Rn. Someone tells you that using C you can express v in terms of a sum of

cosine functions oscillating at different frequencies. Explain why!
(3) What is IC,E and how can it be used for frequency analysis of an audio signal?
(4) When compressing audio signals, small high-frequency components can be discarded.

Using this observation, develop a lossy compression algorithm for audio signals!

Solution. (1) We first check columns are orthonormal. Define the columns of the matrix C to
be

C = [u0 u1 u2 · · · un−1].
so that the element of each vector is given by

ul,k = α(k) cos

)
,

where

α(0) =

√

and α(k) =

This means that

and the same for the other dot products, e.g. u0 · u2 = 0. To prove the general n case, one
uses the trigonometric identity. Let m, k and n be integers, then one has

n∑


n, for k = m = 0,

To prove this, one re-writes the above as

n∑
`=1

(
cos

π

2n
(2`− 1)(k −m) + cos π

2n
(2`− 1)(k +m)

)
.

If k 6= m, then these functions are cosines (graph it!) and their sums over an interval number
of half-cycles are zero. On the other hand, if k = m 6= 0, then the sum of the second term
evaluates to zero (since it is a cosine) while the first term is cos(0) = 1 and summed over n
terms and divided by two so that the end product is n

2
. Finally, if k = m = 0, the sum is n.

This proves orthonormality.
(2) Since C is a basis of Rn, we can write each vector v as a linear combination of u0, . . .un−1.
Observe that The uk is a sample of n points on the graph of the function

fk,n(x) :=

√
2

n
cos(

k

2
x+

kπ

2n
).

Indeed, the entries of uk are the values of fk,n at 0,
2π
n
, . . . , (n−1)2π

n
. Thus we can think of the

vector uk as an approximation of the cosine function fk, n. For example, consider n = 4 and
k = 2. Then the vector u2 contains value of f2,4 evaluated at 0, π/2, π and 3/2π. Below is the
graph of f2,4 including the four data points.

Let us express a vector v =

 = 0.75u0 − 0.867837u1 + 0.75u2 − 1.17126u3.
Set

fv(x) = 0.75f0,4 − 0.867837f1,4 + 0.75f2,4 − 1.17126f3,4.
Then the entries of v are precisely the values of fv at 0,

π
2
, π, 3π

. In the graph below, the blue

curve is fv. The other four curves are 0.75f0,4, −0.867837f1,4 and 0.75f2,4 and −1.17126f3,4.

(3) Since C is orthonormal, IC,E is simply CT . Thus multiplying a vector v in Rn by CT ,

calculates vC. Thus if vC =

 z0...
zn−1

, then
v = z0u0 + · · ·+ zn−1un−1.

Now think of v as an audio signal. So each entry of v corresponds to the amplitude of the audio
signal at a given time. As observed above each ui corresponds to cosine wave of a different
frequency. Thus each zi tells how much a signal of the corresponding frequency contributes to
v.
(4) Start with v. Calculate vC. Drop entries corresponding to higher frequency waves that are
smaller than given threshold ε. Or: if you are willing to drop higher frequency components all
together, take m < n and project v onto Span(u0, . . . ,um). (There are more tricks to it, but
this is the basic mathematical idea behind it. See the Wikipedia article on data compression
for more information.) �
