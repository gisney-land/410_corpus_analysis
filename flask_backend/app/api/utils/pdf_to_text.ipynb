      "\n",
      "Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (Kinda)\n",
      "\n",
      "C is the de-facto programming language to do serious system serious programming. Why? Most kernels are written in\n",
      "largely in C. The Linux Kernel [6] and the XNU kernel Inc. [2] of which Mac OS X is based off. The Windows Kernel uses\n",
      "C++, but doing system programming on that is much harder on windows that UNIX for beginner system programmers.\n",
      "Most of you have some experience with C++, but C is a different beast entirely. You don’t have nice abstractions like classes\n",
      "and RAII to clean up memory. You are going to have to do that yourself. C gives you much more of an opportunity to shoot\n",
      "yourself in the foot but lets you do thinks at a much finer grain level.\n",
      "\n",
      "History of C\n",
      "C was developed by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson at Bell Labs back in 1973 [7]. Back then, we had gems of\n",
      "programming languages like Fortran, ALGOL, and LISP. The goal of C was two fold. One, to target the most popular\n",
      "computers at the time liek the PDP-7. Two, try and remove some of the lower level constructs like managing registers,\n",
      "programming assembly for jumps and instead create a language that had the power to express programs procedurally (as\n",
      "opposed to mathematically like lisp) with more readable code all while still having the ability to interface with the operating\n",
      "system. It sounded like a tough feat. At first, it was only used internally at Bell Labs along with the UNIX operating system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first \"real\" standardization is with Brian Kerninghan and Dennis Ritchies book [5]. It is still widely regarded today\n",
      "as the only Portable set of C instructions. The K&R book is known as the de-facto standard for learning C. There were\n",
      "different standards of C from ANSI to ISO after the Unix guides. The one that we will be mainly focusing on is the POSIX C\n",
      "library. Now to get the elephant out of the room, the Linux kernel is not entirely POSIX compliant. Mostly, it is because\n",
      "they didn’t want to pay the fee for compliance but also it doesn’t want to be completely compliant with a bunch of different\n",
      "standards because then it has to ensue increasing development costs to maintain compliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward however many years, and we are at the current C standard put forth by ISO: C11. Not all the code that we\n",
      "us in this class will be in this format. We will aim to using C99 as the standard that most computers recognize. We will\n",
      "talk about some off-hand features like getline because they are so widely used with the GNU-C library. We’ll begin by\n",
      "providing a decently comprehensive overview of the language with pairing facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Features\n",
      "• Fast. There is nothing separating you and the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Simple. C and its standard library pose a simple set of portable functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Memory Management. C let’s you manage your memory. This can also bite you if you have memory errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "• It’s Everywhere. Pretty much every computer that is not embedded has some way of interfacing with C. The standard\n",
      "library is also everywhere. C has stood the test of time as a popular language, and it doesn’t look like it is going\n",

      "Crash course intro to C\n",
      "The only way to start learning C is by starting with hello world. As per the original example that Kernighan and Ritchie\n",
      "proposed way back when, the hello world hasn’t changed that much.\n",
      "\n",
      "#include <stdio.h>\n",
      "int main(void) {\n",

      "1. The #include directive takes the file stdio.h (which stands for standard input and output) located somewhere in\n",
      "your operating system, copies the text, and substitutes it where the #include was.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The int main(void) is a function declaration. The first word int tells the compiler what the return type of the\n",
      "function is. The part before the parens (main) is the function name. In C, no two functions can have the same name\n",
      "in a single compiled program, shared libraries are a different touchy subject. Then, what comes after is the paramater\n",
      "list. When we give the parameter list for regular functions (void) that means that the compiler should error if the\n",
      "function is called with any arguments. For regular functions having a declaration like void func() means that\n",
      "you are allowed to call the function like func(1, 2, 3) because there is no delimiter [4]. In the case of main, it\n",
      "is a special function. There are many ways of declaring main but the ones that you will be familiar with are int\n",
      "main(void), int main(), and int main(int argc, char *argv[]).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. printf(\"Hello World\"); is what we call a function call. printf is defined as a part of stdio.h. The function\n",

      "function with the appropriate parameters (a string literal \"Hello World\"). If you don’t have the newline, the\n",

      "Preprocessor\n",
      "What is the preprocessor? Preprocessing is an operation that the compiler performs before actually compiling the program.\n",

      "\n",
      "There are side effects to the preprocessor though. One problem is that the preprocessor needs to be able to tokenize\n",
      "properly, meaning trying to redefine the interals of the C language with a preprocessor may be impossible. Another problem\n",
      "is that they can’t be nested infinitely – there is an unbounded depth where they need to stop. Macros are also just simple\n",
      "text substitutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "#define min(a,b) ((a)<(b) ? (a) : (b))\n",
      "int x = 4;\n",
      "if(min(x++, 5)) printf(\"%d is six\", x);\n",
      "\n",
      "Macros are simple text substitution so the above example expands to x++ < 100 ? x++ : 100 (parenthesis omitted\n",
      "for clarity). Now for this case, it is opaque what gets printed out but it will be 6. Also consider the edge case when operator\n",
      "precedence comes into play.\n",

      "int x = 99;\n",
      "int r = 10 + min(99, 100); // r is 100!\n",
      "\n",
      "Macros are simple text substitution so the above example expands to 10 + 99 < 100 ? 99 : 100. You can have\n",
      "logical problems with the flexibility of certain parameters. One common source of confusion is with static arrays and the\n",
      "sizeof operator.\n",
      "\n",
      "#define ARRAY_LENGTH(A) (sizeof((A)) / sizeof((A)[0]))\n",
      "int static_array[10]; // ARRAY_LENGTH(static_array) = 10\n",
      "int* dynamic_array = malloc(10); // ARRAY_LENGTH(dynamic_array) = 2 or 1\n",
      "\n",
      "What is wrong with the macro? Well, it works if we have a static array like the first array because sizeof a static array\n",
      "returns the number of bytes that array takes up, and dividing it by the sizeof(an_element) would give you the number\n",
      "of entries. But if we use a pointer to a piece of memory, taking the sizeof the pointer and dividing it by the size of the first\n",
      "entry won’t always give us the size of the array.\n",
      "\n",
      "Language Facilities\n",
      "\n",
      "Keywords\n",
      "C has an assortment of keywords. Here are some constructs that you should know briefly as of C99.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. break is a keyword that is used in case statements or looping statements. When used in a case statement, the\n",
      "program jumps to the end of the block.\n",

      "\n",
      "} /* Continues here */\n",
      "\n",
      "2. const is a language level construct that tells the compiler that this data should not be modified. If one tries to change\n",
      "a const variable, the program will not even compile. const works a little differently when put before the type, the\n",
      "compiler flips the first type and const. Then the compiler uses a left associativity rule. Meaning that whatever is left\n",
      "of the pointer is constant. This is known as const-correctedness.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "CPU Scheduling is the problem of efficiently selecting which process to run on a system’s CPU cores. In a busy system,\n",
      "there will be more ready-to-run processes than there are CPU cores, so the system kernel must evaluate which processes\n",
      "should be scheduled to run and which processes should be executed later. The system must also decide whether or not it\n",
      "should take a particular process and pause its execution – along with any associated threads. The balance comes from\n",
      "stopping processes often enough where you have a responsive computer but infrequently enough where the programs\n",
      "themselves are not spending a lot of cycles context switching. It is a hard balance it get right.\n",
      "\n",
      "The additional complexity of multi-threaded and multiple CPU cores are considered a distraction to this initial exposition\n",
      "so are ignored here. Another gotcha for non-native speakers is the dual meanings of “Time”: The word “Time” can be used\n",
      "in both clock and elapsed duration context. For example “The arrival time of the first process was 9:00am.” and, “The\n",
      "running time of the algorithm is 3 seconds”.\n",
      "\n",
      "One clarification that we will make is that our scheduling will mainly deal with short term or cpu scheduling. That\n",
      "means we will assume that the processes are in memory and ready to go. The other types of scheduling are long and\n",
      "medium term. Long term schedulers act as gatekeepers to the processing world. When a process requests another process\n",
      "to be executed, it can either tell tell the process yes, no, or wait. The medium term scheduler deals with the caveats of\n",
      "moving a process from the paused state in memory to the paused state on disk when there are too many processes or some\n",

      "once an hour).\n",
      "\n",
      "Measurements\n",
      "Scheduling effects the performance of the system, specifically the latency and throughput of the system. The throughput\n",
      "might be measured by a system value, for example the I/O throughput - the number of bits written per second, or number\n",
      "of small processes that can complete per unit time. The latency might be measured by the response time – elapse time\n",
      "before a process can start to send a response – or wait time or turnaround time –the elapsed time to complete a task.\n",
      "Different schedulers offer different optimization trade-offs that may or may not be appropriate to desired use. There is no\n",
      "optimal scheduler for all possible environments and goals. For example ‘shortest-job-first’ will minimize total wait time\n",
      "across all jobs but in interactive (UI) environments it would be preferable to minimize response time at the expense of\n",
      "some throughput, while FCFS seems intuitively fair and easy to implement but suffers from the Convoy Effect. Arrival time\n",
      "is the time at which a process first arrives at the ready queue, and is ready to start executing. If a CPU is idle, the arrival\n",
      "time would also be the starting time of execution.\n",

      "What is preemption?\n",
      "Without preemption processes will run until they are unable to utilize the CPU any further. For example the following\n",
      "conditions would remove a process from the CPU and the CPU would be available to be scheduled for other processes: The\n",
      "process terminates due to a signal, is blocked waiting for concurrency primitive, or exits normally. Thus once a process is\n",
      "scheduled it will continue even if another process with a high priority (e.g. shorter job) appears on the ready queue.\n",
      "\n",
      "With preemption, the existing processes may be removed immediately if a more preferable process is added to the ready\n",
      "queue. For example, suppose at t=0 with a Shortest Job First scheduler there are two processes (P1 P2) with 10 and 20 ms\n",
      "execution times. P1 is scheduled. P1 immediately creates a new process P3, with execution time of 5 ms, which is added\n",
      "to the ready queue. Without preemption, P3 will run 10ms later (after P1 has completed). With preemption, P1 will be\n",
      "immediately evicted from the CPU and instead placed back in the ready queue, and P3 will be executed instead by the CPU.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which schedulers suffer from starvation?\n",
      "Any scheduler that uses a form of prioritization can result in starvation because earlier processes may never be scheduled\n",
      "to run (assigned a CPU). For example with SJF, longer jobs may never be scheduled if the system continues to have many\n",
      "short jobs to schedule. It all depends on the type of scheduler.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why might a process (or thread) be placed on the ready queue?\n",
      "A process is placed on the ready queue when it is able to use a CPU. Some examples include:\n",
      "\n",
      "• A process was blocked waiting for a read from storage or socket to complete and data is now available.\n",
      "\n",
      "• A new process has been created and is ready to start.\n",
      "\n",
      "• A process thread was blocked on a synchronization primitive (condition variable, semaphore, mutex lock) but is now\n",
      "able to continue.\n",

      "1. Turnaround Time is the total time from when you the process arrives to when it ends. end_time - arrival_time\n",

      "3. Wait Time is the total wait time i.e. the total time that a process is on the ready queue. A common mistake is to\n",
      "believe it is only the initial waiting time in the ready queue. If a CPU intensive process with no I/O takes 7 minutes\n",
      "of CPU time to complete but required 9 minutes of wall-clock time to complete we can conclude that it was placed on\n",
      "the ready-queue for 2 minutes. For those 2 minutes the process was ready to run but had no CPU assigned. It does\n",

      "Two types of files\n",
      "On linux, there are two abstractions with files. The first is the linux fd level abstraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "• open takes a path to a file and creates a file descriptor entry in the process table. If the file is not available to you, it\n",
      "errors out.\n",
      "\n",
      "• read takes a number of bytes that the kernel has received and reads them into a user space buffer. If the file is not\n",
      "open in read mode, this will break.\n",
      "\n",
      "• write outputs a number of bytes to a file descriptor. If the file is not open in write mode, this will break. This may\n",
      "be buffered internally.\n",
      "\n",
      "• close removes a file descriptor from a process’ file descriptors. This always succeeds on a valid file descriptor.\n",
      "\n",
      "• lseek takes a file descriptor and moves it to a certain position. Can fail if the seek is out of bounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "• fcntl is the catch all function for file descriptors. You can do everything with this function. Set file locks, read,\n",
      "write, edit permissions, etc . . .\n",
      "\n",
      "• . . .\n",
      "\n",
      "And so on. The linux interface is very powerful and expressive, but sometimes we need portability (for example if we\n",
      "are writing for a mac or windows). This is where C’s abstraction comes into play. On different operating systems, C uses the\n",
      "low level functions to create a wrapper around files you can use everywhere, meaning that C on linux uses the above calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "• fopen opens a file and returns an object. null is returned if you don’t have permission for the file.\n",
      "\n",
      "• fread reads a certain number of bytes from a file. An error is returned if already at the end of file when which you\n",

      "the file. The kernel can actually do some optimizations too. Instead of loading the file into memory, it may only load pages\n",
      "at a time because if the file is 1024 pages; you may only access 3 or 4 pages making loading the entire file a waste of time.\n",

      "Remember that once you are done mmapping that you munmap to tell the operating system that you are no longer using the\n",

      "\n",
      "TCP In Depth\n",
      "TCP has a number of features that set it apart from the other transport protocol UDP.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Ports. With IP, you are only allowed to send packets to a machine. If you want one machine to handle multiple\n",
      "flows of data, you have to do it manually with IP. TCP abstracts that an gives the programmer a set of virtual\n",
      "sockets. Clients specify the socket that you want the packet sent to and the TCP protocol makes sure that\n",
      "applications that are waiting for packets on that port receive that.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Retransmission. Packets can get dropped due to network errors or congestion. As such, they need to be\n",
      "retransmitted but at the same time the retransmission shouldn’t cause packets more packets to be dropped.\n",
      "This needs to balance the tradeoff between flooding the network and speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Out of order packets. Packets may get routed more favorably due to various reasons in IP. If a later packet\n",
      "arrives before another packet, the protocol should detect and reorder them.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Duplicate packets. Packets can arrive twice. Packets can arrive twice. As such, a protocol need to be able to\n",
      "differentiate between two packets given a sequence number subject to overflow.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Error correction. There is a TCP checksum that handles bit errors. This is rarely used though.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Flow Control. Flow control is performed on the receiver side. This may be done so that a slow receiver doesn’t\n",
      "get overwhelmed with packets. Servers especially that may handle 10000 or 10 million concurrent connection\n",
      "may need to tell receivers to slow down, but not disconnect due to load. There are also other prorblem of\n",
      "making sure the local network is not overwhelmed\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Congestion control. Congestion control is performed on the sender side. Congestion control is to avoid a\n",
      "sender from flooding the network with too many packets. This is really important to make sure that each TCP\n",
      "connection is treated fairly. Meaning that two connections leaving a computer to google and youtube receive\n",
      "the same bandwidth and ping as each other. One can easily define a protocol that takes all the bandwidth\n",
      "and leaves other protocols in the dust, but this tends to be malicious because more often than not limiting a\n",
      "computer to a single TCP connection will yield the same result.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Connection oriented/lifecycle oriented. You can really imagine a TCP connection as a series of bytes sent\n",
      "through a pipe. TCP handles setting up the connection through SYN SYN-ACK ACK. Then every so often if a\n",
      "packet is not sent, TCP will trade zero length packets to make sure the connection is still alive. At any point,\n",
      "the client and server can say that I am done writing on this connection, I will only consume and same for\n",
      "reading. Finally TCP has ways of detecting a connection dies and whether a connection comes back to life in\n",
      "the specified time frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a list of things that TCP doesn’t provide though\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Security. This means that if you connect to an IP address that says that it is a certain website, TCP does not\n",
      "verify that this website is in fact that IP address. You could be sending packets to a malicious computer.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Encryption. Anybody can listen in on plain TCP. The packets in transport are in plain text meaning that\n",
      "important things like your passwords could easily be skimmed by servers and regularly are.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Session Reconnection. This is handled by a higher protocols, but if a TCP connection dies then a whole new\n",
      "one hast to be created and the transmission has to be started over again.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Delimiting Requests. TCP is naturally connection oriented. Applications that are communicating over TCP\n",
      "need to find a unique way of telling each other that this request or response is over. HTTP uses either a length\n",
      "field or one keeps listening until the connection closes\n",

      "Note on network orders\n",
      "Integers can be represented in least significant byte first or most-significant byte first. Either approach is reasonable as long\n",

      "htons(xyz) returns the 16 bit unsigned integer ‘short’ value xyz in network byte order. htonl(xyz) returns the 32\n",

      "These functions are read as ‘host to network’; the inverse functions (ntohs, ntohl) convert network ordered byte values\n",
      "to host-ordered ordering. So, is host-ordering little-endian or big-endian? The answer is - it depends on your machine! It\n",
      "depends on the actual architecture of the host running the code. If the architecture happens to be the same as network\n",
      "ordering then the result of these functions is just the argument. For x86 machines, the host and network ordering is\n",
      "different.\n",

      "the real file must be opened and read. Another disadvantage is that POSIX will not let you hard link directories whereas\n",

      "Pathing\n",
      "Now that we have definitions talk about directories, we come across the concept of a path. A path is a sequence of directories\n",

      "Signals have been a unix construct since the beginning. They are a convenient way to deliver low-priority information\n",
      "and for users to interact with their programs when no other form of interaction is available like using standard input.\n",
      "Signals allow a program to cleanup or perform an action in the case of an event. Some time, a program can choose to\n",
      "ignore events and that is completely fine and even supported by the standard. Crafting a program that uses signals well is\n",
      "tricky due ot all the rules with inheritance. As such, signals are usually kept as cleanup or termination measures.\n",
      "\n",

      "signals both in a single and multithreaded way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Deep Dive of Signals\n",
      "A signal is a construct provided to us by the kernel. It allows one process to asynchronously send an event (think a message)\n",
      "to another process. If that process wants to accept the signal, it can, and then, for most signals, can decide what to do with\n",
      "that signal. Here is a short list (non comprehensive) of signals. The overall process for how a kernel sends a signal as well\n",
      "as common use cases are below.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Before any signals are generated, the kernel sets up the default signal handlers for a process.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. If still no signals have arrived, the process can install its own signal handlers. This is simple telling the kernel that\n",
      "when the process gets signal X it should jump to function Y.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Now is the fun part, time to deliver a signal! Signals can come from various places below. The signal is now in what\n",
      "we call the generated state.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. As soon as the signal starts to get deliverd by the kernel, it is in the pending state.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The kernel then checks the signals disposition, which in layperson terms is whether the process is willing to\n",
      "accept that signal at this point. If not, then the signal is currently blocked and nothing happens.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. If not, and there is no signal handler installed, the kernel executes the default action. Otherwise, the kernel delivers\n",
      "the signal by stopping whatever the process is doing at the current point, and jumping that process to the signal\n",
      "handler. If the program is multithreaded, then the process picks on thread with a signal disposition that can accept\n",
      "the signal and freezes the rest. The signal is now in the delivered phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Finally, we consider a signal caught if the process remains in tact after the signal was delivered.\n",
